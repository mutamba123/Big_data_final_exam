Project Introduction

Many countries face challenges achieving universal secondary school enrollment.
Goal: Identify countries and regions where enrollment lags.
Explore socio-economic factors driving these gaps (e.g., GDP, literacy, urbanization).
Use big data analytics & visualization to uncover actionable insights.

Dataset & Methodology

Dataset:https://data.uis.unesco.org

Source: UNESCO UIS Data

Structured CSV, ~2500 rows Ã— 10 columns

Variables: Country, Region, Year, Enrollment Rate, GDP per capita, Literacy Rate, Urbanization, Population, etc.

Methodology:

1.Data cleaning & preprocessing

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.Clustering (KMeans)

4.Visualization & dashboard in Power BI

EDA Results

- Histograms & boxplots: Show distribution & detect outliers.
 
- Correlation heatmap: Found positive correlation between:
 
- GDP per capita & Enrollment Rate
  
- Literacy Rate & Enrollment Rate
  
- Regional comparison: Some regions consistently below global average.
