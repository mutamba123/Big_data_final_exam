Project Introduction

Many countries face challenges achieving universal secondary school enrollment.
Goal: Identify countries and regions where enrollment lags.
Explore socio-economic factors driving these gaps (e.g., GDP, literacy, urbanization).
Use big data analytics & visualization to uncover actionable insights.

Dataset & Methodology

Dataset:https://data.uis.unesco.org

Source: UNESCO UIS Data

Structured CSV, ~2500 rows Ã— 10 columns

Variables: Country, Region, Year, Enrollment Rate, GDP per capita, Literacy Rate, Urbanization, Population, etc.

Methodology:

1.Data cleaning & preprocessing

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.Clustering (KMeans)

4.Visualization & dashboard in Power BI

EDA Results

- Histograms & boxplots: Show distribution & detect outliers.
 
- Correlation heatmap: Found positive correlation between:
 
- GDP per capita & Enrollment Rate
  
- Literacy Rate & Enrollment Rate
  
- Regional comparison: Some regions consistently below global average.

Most countries have high enrollment rates, but some still lag behind highlighting regional inequality

Regions differ in both median enrollment and variability. Some regions show wide gaps among countries, highlighting unequal education opportunities.

Higher GDP and literacy strongly relate to better enrollment rates. Urbanization also contributes, though to a lesser extent.


Clustering & Insights

- Used KMeans to group countries with similar profiles.
  
- Evaluated with silhouette score.
  
- Identified clusters:

- High GDP & high enrollment
  
- Medium GDP & medium enrollment
  
- Low GDP & low enrollment
  
- Helps policymakers target similar countries together
